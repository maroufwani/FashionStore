            <h5>Care Instructions:</h5>
            Taking proper care of your Men's Cotton Shirt with Box Pattern will help maintain its quality and appearance. Here are some care instructions to follow:<br><br>
            <b>Machine Wash:</b> You can safely machine wash this shirt. Use cold or lukewarm water (not hot) to prevent any shrinkage or color fading.<br>
            <b>Gentle Cycle:</b> When using a washing machine, choose the gentle or delicate cycle to protect the fabric.<br>
            <b>Mild Detergent:</b> Use a mild, color-safe detergent to maintain the vibrancy of the shirt's colors and patterns.<br>
            <b>Avoid Bleach:</b> Do not use bleach or harsh chemicals, as they can damage the fabric and patterns.<br>
            <b>Separate Colors:</b> If washing with other garments, separate colors to prevent color bleeding.<br>
            <b>Turn Inside Out:</b> To protect the box pattern and buttons, turn the shirt inside out before washing.<br>
            <b>Fasten Buttons:</b> Fasten all the buttons on the shirt to prevent them from snagging on other items during washing.<br>
            <b>Avoid Overloading:</b> Do not overload the washing machine, as this can cause excessive wrinkling and reduce the effectiveness of cleaning.<br>
            <b>Dry Carefully:</b> After washing, reshape the shirt and hang it on a hanger to air dry. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can fade colors over time.<br>
            <b>Ironing:</b> If necessary, iron the shirt on a medium heat setting. Iron the inside of the shirt to avoid direct contact with the box pattern.<br>
            <b>Dry Cleaning:</b> While the shirt is suitable for machine washing, for the best care, consider professional dry cleaning when needed.<br><br>
            By following these care instructions, you can ensure that your Cotton Shirt maintains its quality, colors, and pattern, allowing you to enjoy its stylish and comfortable features for a long time.
